/**
 * <p>
 * Creates a #{@link Callable} whose #{@literal call} method will block until 
 * the #{@literal executeInvocationContext()} method is called. This comes in
 * handy when returning Futures (eg: #{@literal new FutureTask(
 new CallableInvoker(invoker))}).
 * </p><p>
 * In the simplest case #{@literal executeInvocationContext()} could be called 
 * in the same thread prior to calling #{@literal call()}. This is useful when 
 * your method of executing in the background is also #{@link Runnable} or 
 * #{@link Callable} and can thus be used to return a #{@link RunnableFuture}.
 * </p><p>
 * In more complex cases #{@literal executeInvocationContext()} could be called 
 * by a separate thread at any time before or after the current thread calls 
 * #{@literal call()}. This is useful when your method of executing in the background is 
 * fairly arbitrary (eg a Quartz Job scheduled for the near future), and you need
 * to be able to return a #{@literal new FutureTask(callable)} immediately
 * but trigger the processing on that callable some arbitrary way (ie: inside the
 * Quartz Job implementation).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * See the Seam Cron Asynchronous Provider projects for the Threads and Quartz providers
 * to see this in action (providers/scheduling/quartz and providers/asynchronous/threads).
