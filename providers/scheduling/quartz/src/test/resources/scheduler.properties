# This file defines the set of available schedules in the form:
# name=schedule
# Each schedule may be used for ne or more jobs. If more than one job is
# is assigned to a single schedule then those jobs will be executed in a
# round robin style.

# Open issues:
# 1. For round robin, what if the previous job has not completed? Should it
# wait until next scheduled time or should it start as soon as the previous
# job finishes?
# 2. What is the best interpretation of 12:00/5? For a single job it would
# most obviously be that the job would run every 5 minutes, starting at 12:00.
# But if you added multiple jobs, would they continue to round robin around
# the clock or would they only ru until all the jobs have been executed once,
# and then wait for 12:00 to come again?

# This schedule is called "test.one" and runs every 5 seconds
test.one=*/5 * * ? * *

# This schedule is called "test.two" and runs at precisely 1:12 PM every day
test.two=13:12

# This schedule is called "test.three" and will execute every 5 minutes,
# starting at 12:00PM.
test.three=12:00/5
# could also be per-job,
test.three.qeueumode=delayed
